Apphus AppSecurity Project Guide

Hello, and welcome.  Thanks for checking out the Apphus AppSecurity project.  We are delivering a new level of security to your projects on the web.

Goal

Functional Double Submit Cookie package using Oauth2 and JWT Tokens and CSRF for stateless authentication. No need for session checks on each request.

Methods

Partnered programming...what else should go here Peter?

Styles

The Apphus AppSecurity project follows the Airbnb Style Guide https://github.com/airbnb/javascript with a focus on descriptive method and variable names.  We write readable code.

Roles

We are currently looking for contributers.   Anyone interested in all-round persistant internet security, plain and simple JavaScript/AJAX while uncovering the holy grail of "best practices", and performant and efficient code is encouraged to apply.  The goal is that any Pair-Programmers in on this would benefit equally as long as THEY CAN AND WILL EQUALY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECT.
